Test application of the framework AR, in the scope of my thesis "Web Augmented Reality Applied to Cultural Heritage".
This project tests the use of fiducial markers as the tracking method for the Augmented Reality experience. Consult AR.js at "https://ar-js-org.github.io/AR.js-Docs/marker-based/" for documentation.
