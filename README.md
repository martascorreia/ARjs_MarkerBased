Test application of AR.js, in the scope of my thesis "Web Augmented Reality Applied to Cultural Heritage".
This project tests the use of fiducial/passive markers as the tracking method for the Augmented Reality experience. Consult AR.js at "https://ar-js-org.github.io/AR.js-Docs/marker-based/" for documentation.

Passive Markers are a camera-based technique that uses computer vision algorithms to detect easily recognizable markers (e.g., QR codes). The disadvantages of this technique include its intrusiveness, as it requires placing the marker at the location of the experience, and its need for good lighting to recognize the marker. Its major advantage is having a good processing speed since the markers used are easy to track.

To see this project working:
  1. access "https://martascorreia.github.io/ARjs_MarkerBased/";
  2. point the camera to the passive marker "https://github.com/martascorreia/ARjs_MarkerBased/blob/main/passive-marker.png".
     
In the folder "video" of this repository, is a video of the experience working.
